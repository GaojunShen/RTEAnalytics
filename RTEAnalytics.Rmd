###Background
We have performed analysis of electricity data provided by the French Distribution Network (RTE)

####Analysis
1. Comparison between supply and demand
2. Evolution of energy mix
3. Correlation between time of the day and solar energy production 
4. Correlation between time of the day and wind energy
5. Correlation between supply and demand vs. import/export
6. Correlation between consumption and weather

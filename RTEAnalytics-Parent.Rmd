###Introduction
We have performed analysis of electricity data provided by the French Distribution Network (RTE)

####Analysis
1. Background on electricity in France
2. Evolution of energy mix
3. Correlation studies

####Source

Open data: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/electricite-consommation-production-co2-et-echanges/

###Conclusion
We have become more familiar with R by using the set of data. We have confirmed seveal of our assumptions by querying the set of data including:
- the balance of the energy over the period under study
- the evolution of the mix of energy over the period under study
- various sets of correlation
